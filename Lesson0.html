                    Vim is different than other editors you have used. It is
                    <i>modal</i>. By default, keys you hit do <i>not</i> go
                    into the document you are editing! Instead, they trigger
                    commands. So the first thing you need to do is figure out
                    how to enter text, stop entering text, delete text,
                    save your file, and leave the program.

                    The Five Most Important Commands
                </h3>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>
                            Keys to type
                        </th>
                        <th>
                            What they do
                        </th>

                        </td>
                        <td>
                        Shift into insert mode, and actually be able
                        to enter text!

                        <td>
                        The escape key exits insert mode, and puts
                    you back in command mode. (Ctrl-C does the same thing.)

                        <td>
                        In command mode, this writes your current
                        file to disk.

                    Practice
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Call up a practice file in vim (e.g., <i>vim
                        practice.txt</i>)
                    and practice each of the above four commands until your fingers
                    find them almost automatically.
