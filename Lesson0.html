            <h2>
                The Absolute Basics
            </h2>

                <p>
                    Vim is different than other editors you have used. It is
                    <i>modal</i>. By default, keys you hit do <i>not</i> go
                    into the document you are editing! Instead, they trigger
                    commands. So the first thing you need to do is figure out
                    how to enter text, stop entering text, and save your file.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    The Four Most Important Commands
                </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><i>i</i>: shift into insert mode, and actually be able
                    to enter text!
                    <li><i>Esc</i>: the escape key exits insert mode, and puts
                    you back in command mode.
                    <li><i>x</i>: delete character under the cursor.
                    <li><i>:wq</i>: in command mode, this writes your current
                    file to disk and exits vim.
                </ul>

                <h3>
                    Homework
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Call up a practice file in vim (vim practice.txt) and
                    practice each of the above four commands until your fingers
                    find them almost automatically.
