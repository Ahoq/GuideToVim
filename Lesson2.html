                Changing regions of text
            </h2>

                <h3>
                    By character
                </h3>

                <p>
                    <span class="vim_key">x</span>:
                    already mentioned; deletes one character.
                    <br>
                    <b>r</b>: replaces one character with the next one typed.
                    <br>
                    <b>s</b>: substitutes for a single character whatever is
                    typed next until <b>Esc</b> is hit.
                    <br>
                    Why use r instead of s?
                    <br>
                    <b>r</b> and <b>s</b> seem to do almost the same thing. Why
                    use <b>r</b>, when <b>s</b> seems more flexible? Well, if
                    you know you only need to substitute one character for
                    another, <b>r</b> saves you from entering insert mode, and
                    then having to leave it.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    By word
                </h3>

                <p>
                    <b>cw</b>:
                    Changes the word under the cursor to whatever is typed up
                    until <b>Esc</b>.
                    <br>
                    <b>dw</b>:
                    Deletes the word under the cursor.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h3>
                    By line
                </h3>

                <p>
                    <b>dd</b>:
                    <br>
                    Deletes the entire line of text under the cursor.
                    <br>
                    <b>C</b>:
                    <br>
                    Changes the line from the point the cursor is at on.
                    <br>
                    <b>J</b>:
                    <br>
                    Pulls the next line up into the line the cursor is on.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Adding a count
                </h3>

                <p>
                Most of these commands can take a number in front, so <b>10cw</b>
                changes ten words.
                </p>
